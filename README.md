# StickyTree
StickyTree is an IntelliJ IDE plugin, that turns expanded nodes in the project file tree "sticky". This makes the parents of any subdirectories you are currently looking at always visible, which helps not to lose track of where you are in a large project while scrolling through your files.  

The plugin is currently in an alpha state. The most basic functionality works, but it may feel incomplete. There is no documentation and no settings/customisation. These will need to be added along with some more general polishing before an eventual marketplace release.  
To use this plugin already, just run the IntelliJ "buildPlugin" Gradle task and install it as a zip file in any IntelliJ IDE (Community or Ultimate) newer than 2025.1.
